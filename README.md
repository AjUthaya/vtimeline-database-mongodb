VTimeline is a content management system that allows you to create a vertical full screen timeline, where you can easily add, update or delete events. So let's say that you need a way to present a number of historical events or your life story for that matter, then this is the solution for you. You are able to add an image, title, description, start and end date to your event. The events will automatically be ordered ascending based on the start date.
